How to prevent the InteractiveBrokers application from closing

Configure the some time you are not going to trade, for example 2AM. Just before 2AM pause the java application until after 2AM. In Linux you can pause an application by
      kill -STOP <java process ID>
or, if there are no other java applications running
      killall -STOP java
and resume by
      killall -CONT java

My setup is a hammer candle (defined as a candle with a close in the upper half of the range with a lower shadow at least 2x the real body) and the next bar a break of the high. I place my stop at the low of that candle (daily). My exit rules are at 1.2R (risk) I move stop to breakeven, at 2R I trail a 25% trailing stop, and at 4R I exit on a limit. If I get 3 consecutive closers outside the bollinger I exit on close. If the upper bollinger is flat or fallingI exit at the upper bollinger. 
 
I had 2 positions on because the first one was at breakeven by the time the second setup came around, and exited like this
