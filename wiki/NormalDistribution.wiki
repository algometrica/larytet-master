= Normal distribution and real financial markets =

When presented with standard deviations, many assume or don’t realize they are assuming an underlying normal distribution and equate mean plus and minus one standard deviation as  two-thirds probability and mean plus and minus two standard deviations as 95 percent  probability. Financial data is typically nonnormal, exhibiting asymmetry and significantly
more observations several standard deviations from the mean, the so-called ‘‘heavy tails.’’ These tails are heavy only by comparison to the normal distribution, not by what is typical in finance data.

Most errors are trivially avoided by using the empirical distribution—the data itself—rather
than assumed mathematical forms. Moreover, it is quite simple to examine the fit of a normal curve to a set of data and judge the accuracy of probability calculations for intervals of interest, be they in the tail or center of the distribution. 

= What worked in 1995-2000 =

 * When the spread increases (decreases) sufficiently far from the mean (say, k standard deviations) sell (buy) the spread.
 * Unwind the positions when the spread returns to the mean.
 * When the spread increases (decreases) sufficiently far from the mean (say, k standard deviations) sell (buy) the spread.
 * Unwind the positions when the spread returns to the mean.
