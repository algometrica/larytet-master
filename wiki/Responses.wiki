Dr Zalicha is right.

While in the short term lower interest rates and purchase of USD, and, we shall not forget huge budget deficits, kept the employment rates steady, in the longer term all of this suppressed the demand. Fisher should and could do more to keep the speculation out of the RE. Instead only last two years the BOI did something in this directions and it was both too little and too late. We are going to pay huge price when serving the accumulated debt (we already are paying) and we did not even enjoy too many sunny days. Some rich guys who was leveraged they indeed made lot of money. 

Fisher was careless and not mindful of long term results of his policies. He probably has hoped year after year that just a little bit more and he will be able to start to push the rates up. The problems he discovered were more structural and remain to be so.
