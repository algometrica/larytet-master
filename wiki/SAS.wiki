==SAS Macros==
===Indirect reference to a macro variable - The Forward Re-Scan rule:===
 * When multiple ampersands or percent signs precede a name token, the macro processor resolves two ampersands (&&) to one ampersand (&), and re-scans the
reference.
 * To re-scan a reference, the macro processor scans and resolves tokens from left to right from the point where multiple ampersands or percent signs are coded, until no more triggers can be resolved.
According to the Forward Re-Scan rule, you need to use three ampersands in front of
a macro variable name when its value matches the name of a second macro variable.

Example Code:
{{{
options symbolgen;
%let C005=Artificial Intelligence;
%let crsid=C005;
%put &C005;
%put &crsid;
%put &&crsid;
%put &&&crsid;
}}}
Log output:
{{{
5    options symbolgen;
6    %let C005=Artificial Intelligence;
7    %let crsid=C005;
8    %put &C005;
SYMBOLGEN:  Macro variable C005 resolves to Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence
9    %put &crsid;
SYMBOLGEN:  Macro variable CRSID resolves to C005
C005
10   %put &&crsid;
SYMBOLGEN:  && resolves to &.
SYMBOLGEN:  Macro variable CRSID resolves to C005
C005
11   %put &&&crsid;
SYMBOLGEN:  && resolves to &.
SYMBOLGEN:  Macro variable CRSID resolves to C005
SYMBOLGEN:  Macro variable C005 resolves to Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence
}}}

===Use SYMGET function to obtain macro variable values:===

Code:
{{{
%let x=100;

data _null_;
	y = symget('x');
	put 'y value is: ' y;
run;
}}}
Log:
{{{
34
35   data _null_;
36       y = symget('x');
37       put 'y value is: ' y;
38   run;

y value is: 100
